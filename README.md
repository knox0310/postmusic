This is a group project where we use GPS in conjunction with a map API to read the current location's postal code, 
then use the postal code to correspond to different sound frequencies, 
and coordinate with the Tone.js library to achieve smooth transitions between each sound.
We visualize the sound frequencies and present them on the canvas.

Anywhere in the UK, you can open the link and hear the sound unique to that location.
